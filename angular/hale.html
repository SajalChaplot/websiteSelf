            <h3 class="titles">Improving Employee Wellness Engagement With Digitisation</h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify;"> Infosys' Indian offices' employ more than <strong class="strong_dehighlight">1.5 lakhs of employees </strong>, a population nearly equal to Shimla. That's right, a whole city working for one company, it is a big feat. However, with such a scale, it became difficult for the company to understand the employees' wellness needs and evolve the wellness program. <strong class="strong_dehighlight"> It had become obsolete!</strong>
            <br><br>

            I became part of a reimagination project of the wellness program aimed at improving wellness culture and productivity.</p>

                        <h3 class="titles"> UX Research & Design </h3>
                         <p>I collaboarted with 5 designers to plan and conduct stakeholder workshops, user research and develop insights for the future of Wellness Program. Post discovery phase, I along with another designer, majorly worked on the mobile solution and collaborated with developers for building the platform.

               <h5 class="small-titles" >Challenge</h5>
               <br><br>
                <h3 class="titles"> Improving User Engagement With Digital First Approach </h3>
                <p>With limited existing digital strategy, it was impossible for the company to analyse employees needs and offer personalized wellness program. Our goal was to improve employees wellness by enabling better engagement with the wellness program, personlized to their needs.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="small-titles" > Project Goals</h5>
                <p>Our High-level Goals were :  <br><br>
                    1. Understanding the employees across geographies <br>
                    2. Transforming Needs into a digital strategy <br>
                    3. Design a mobile solution that seemlessly integrates into the lives of employees <br>
                    4. Measue the engagement</p>
                    <br><br><br>

                <h5 class="small-titles" >Obstacles</h5>
                <p>Every journey has barriers, and our's were - <br> <br>
                    <strong class="strong_dehighlight">1. Humongous Scale </strong>
                    <br>
                    Understanding Employees with a wide range of demographics across different geographies were the biggest roadblock in the initial stages.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong class="strong_dehighlight">2. Communicating Design Outcomes </strong><br>
                    With the usual lack of awareness about design research outcomes and their impact amongst the stakeholders, it was evident that we will have to communicate more often that design is 'not just churning beautiful screens'. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong class="strong_dehighlight">3. Shipping Designs to Building the Solution </strong><br>
                    As often happens in an IT project, not all design ideas can be built, and we realized, an agile methodology would have sped up the entire journey. </p>
