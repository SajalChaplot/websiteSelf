         <p style="text-align:justify;"> 
            Postman allowed free collaboration upto 3 team members. When users decide to collaborate with multiple people for the first time, they may invite more people than free plan allows. When that happens, we ask them to upgrade, and users cannot collaborate and experience the Product's value. This forces users to stick to 3 member teams at max until the team figures out whether they can successfully collaborate on Postman for their use, leading to a longer time in team expansion and upgrade.

                      <p> 
                        I collaborated with Head of Growth and engineers to design the experience for the v1 and v2 of free trial experience. I was involved in deciding key decisions such as increasing trial period from 7 days to 14 days and also whether we should provide trials to professional plans as well. The experience was designed based on tech constraints highlighted during exploration sessions.

            <br><br>
             <h3 class="titles"> Hypothesis </h3>
             <p>
                By allowing more than 3 users to collaborate for a limited time, these teams will realise the collaborative value of Postman and thus increase the paid conversion rate.  
             </p>
    <br>    

            <h3 class="small-titles"> Target Audience </h3>
             <p>
                Free multi member teams inviting more than 3 members. 
             </p>

            <h3 class="titles"> Let's talk about users  </h3>

            <h3 class="small-titles"> Job to be done </h3>
             <p>
                When I am building an API, I want to collaborate with all relevant stakeholder on a single source of truth so that we can build the API as per business needs 
             </p>     

            <h3 class="small-titles"> User Goal </h3>
            <p>
                I want to ensure that our team will be able to actively collaborate on Postman, so that I can make smart choice of purchasing a paid plan.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Note: Majority of our users who would explore the trial capabilities were going to be a group of developers and Quality Engineers. If they could realise the value, they would definitely create a case for upgrades.

             <br><br>
             <p>There were two decisions where I contributed while defining the product spec. These were - 

    <br>
                    <strong class="strong_dehighlight">1. Increasing free trial duration from 7 days to 14 days </strong><br>
                    We made an educated guess based on data that inviting members, accepting those invites, getting onboarded and creation of collaborative files takes more than 7 days.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong class="strong_dehighlight">2. Default trial to team plan :  </strong>
                    <br>
                    Based on data majority of free teams were not showing interest towards integrations and other features of paid plan. Their primary motivation was to collaborate. Basic plan can do that and defaulting it would increase trial opt ins as well as reduce the cost to company.

         2. We use 3rd party vendors for buying event tickets and payment handling. Their system required users to fill the form and then make payment. With form on our site, the user had to enter the same details twice. The marketing head and I discussed with our partner and developed a Techniche exclusive API allowing payment by filling one form on our site, saving effort and time.
